SEGMENT_ID,Number given to a segment within the data. The assigned follows a consecutive sequential order.,numeric
INSTALLED,The year in which the cycling infrastructure was originally installed.,numeric
UPGRADED,"The year in which the cycling infrastructure received upgrades, without changing from shared space to dedicated space. For example, if a bike lane is upgraded to a cycle track, or a signed route is upgraded to a sharrow wayfinding route. Upgrades can be undertaken using pavement markings or physical separation.",numeric

INFRA_LOWORDER,"Refers to the lowest classified cycling infrastructure type installed on this segment. In order of lowest to highest:

Signed Route
Wayfinding Sharrows
Sharrows
Contra-flow Bike Lane
Bike Lane
Bike Lane – Buffered
Multi-Use Trail
Cycle Track
As an example, on a contra-flow route with sharrows on one side, and contra-flow bike lane on the other side, the lowest classified cycling infrastructure type on this street would be the ""Sharrows"". If the street only has one type of cycling infrastructure on both sides, then the input would be the same for both ""INFRA_LOWO"" and ""INFRA_HIGH"".",text
